"""
Drills starting this semester
    - small program
    - reading code and evaluating what the output is or whether there is an error

be able to  write code once and use it twice or more
f(x) = x^2
^takes x as input and outputs x squared

routines u can repeat that outputs something

pros:
    - we can reuse code rather than having to rewrite it all the time
    - much more readable
    
cons:
    - kinda difficult to undewrstand what is happening in the program
    - we introduce a large level of abstraction that we ar enot used to so far
